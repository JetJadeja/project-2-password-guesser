Connor and Jet, nice work on this project. I'm impressed with the challenge you undertook and how you persevered through it. The documentation was thorough and helpful. I enjoyed learning about the EVM and Solidity through your project.  

Late penalty: -2 pts. 
Team score: 41 

- **5/5** Have a graphical interface that allows users to input a password string for testing. (5 pts.)
	- **Isn't a GUI, but very nice CLI**

- **15/15** Include a brute-force algorithm, an algorithm that tries common passwords, and at least one other algorithm of your choice. (15 pts.)

- **8/10** Each user input should be passed to each of your algorithms. 
Include an analysis of the big-O for each of the techniques. This information should be presented to the user in the user interface (10 pts.) 
	- Note: you should include an explanation or proof of the computational complexity. 
You may want to include a dialog box that displays information about a selected algorithm. 
	- **Some of the big-O notations are off (consider using a different variable for the length of your dictionary, and O(128) is better than O(n))**

- **5/5** Provide the user the results of the selected algorithms and tips for improving their password. You may wish to include a password generator that creates strong passwords from scratch or similar to a userâ€™s weak password. (5 pts.)

- **5/5** Demonstrate a clear design that manages complexity and preserves maintainability. (5 pts.)

- **5/5** Include a README.md that describes your application and your approach to solving problems you encountered while creating it. This need not be a diary, but your design should be clearly explained here. (5 pts.)
	- Include the Ethics statement below in your README.
